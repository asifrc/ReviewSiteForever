    <h3>Tech Tip of the Day:</h3>
    <p>
      Do not delete a Heroku App when there is a significant userbase.
      The url is made available again to Heroku and someone else can claim it,
      potentially stealing your users' information. Given that heroku permits
      <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/announcing_better_ssl_for_your_app">piggyback ssl</a>,
      there will be no obvious signs that the site is not authentic, if
      the visual representation of the original site is reproduced.
      This can often be done easily by using the
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> if search engine
      crawling is not deliberately disabled on the original site.
